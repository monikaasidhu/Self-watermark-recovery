# Self Watermark Recovery Scheme

This repository implements a deep learning pipeline for robust image watermark recovery using an autoencoder, U-Net, and latent space transformations. The system combines traditional reconstruction losses with perceptual losses to enhance output quality and watermark fidelity.

## 📋 Overview

This project presents a hybrid architecture for self-recovering watermarks in 512×512 RGB images. The pipeline leverages:
- ***Autoencoder*** for latent feature extraction 
- ***U-Net*** with expanded input channels for detail reconstruction
- ***Latent Decoder*** for cycle-consistent latent space validation
- ***LPIPS perceptual loss*** for human-aligned quality assessment

## 🧩 Key Components

### 1. Autoencoder Architecture
Autoencoder(
(encoder): Sequential( # Input: 3×512×512
Conv2d(3→64), ReLU, Downsample,
Conv2d(64→128), ReLU, Downsample,
Conv2d(128→256), ReLU, Downsample,
Conv2d(256→512) # Latent: 512×32×32
)
(decoder): Sequential( # Input: 512×32×32
ConvTranspose2d(512→256), ReLU, Upsample,
ConvTranspose2d(256→128), ReLU, Upsample,
ConvTranspose2d(128→64), ReLU, Upsample,
ConvTranspose2d(64→3), Sigmoid # Output: 3×512×512
)
)

### 2. U-Net with Expanded Input
Net(
(input_layer): Conv2d(5→64, kernel=3x3) # 3 RGB + 2 latent channels

... standard U-Net architecture ...
(output_layer): Conv2d(64→3, kernel=1x1) # Output: 3×512×512
)

## 🔄 Workflow

1.**Image Preprocessing**
   Load and resize images to 3×512×512.

2. **Feature Extraction**
   Pass the image through the autoencoder encoder to obtain a latent vector of shape 1×512×32×32.

3.**Latent Space Reshaping**
   Upsample and reshape the latent vector to 1×2×512×512.

4. **Multi-Channel U-Net Processing**
   Concatenate the reshaped latent vector (2 channels) with the original image (3 channels) to form a 5-channel input. Pass this input through the U-Net to obtain a reconstructed 3-channel image.

5.**Latent Decoder and Cycle Consistency**
   Use a latent decoder to extract the latent vector from the U-Net output. Reshape and resize this latent vector to 1×512×32×32, and pass it through the decoder part of the autoencoder to reconstruct the image.

6. **Loss Calculation**
   Compute the L1 loss and a perceptual LPIPS loss (weighted by a factor of 5) between the U-Net output and the ground truth. Ensure all images and intermediate results maintain appropriate dimensions throughout the process.

## 📉 Loss Function
The total loss combines pixel-level accuracy and perceptual similarity

total_loss = (l1_loss(reconstructed, target) +
5 * lpips_loss(reconstructed, target) +
l1_loss(cycle_output, original_img))

## ✨ Features

- *Multi-Stage Processing*: Integrates autoencoding, U-Net refinement, and latent validation
- *Dimension Consistency*: Maintains 512×512 resolution throughout
- *Hybrid Loss*: Balances L1 (MAE) and LPIPS perceptual losses
- *Cycle Consistency*: Ensures latent space interpretability via reconstruction
